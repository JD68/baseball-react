- Real App with real baseball history database! 
- Have profressionally built two apps like this but not baseball of course.
- May host app and have link to github code.
- Intially purpose is this is a learning task. 
- Learning EmacScript 6.
- Learning React and then Angular 2 with typescript
- Will do React (this one) first and then in Angular 2 with typescript
- After initial purpose is complete can show to potential employers.
- After initial purpose is complete can move on to testing, services, database, etc... Full stack


- Four components: Input control, divisional team standings, chart summary stats, details view.
- In input control can select the view which effects chart and details. 
- Chart is grouping, click on grouping and see grouping details in details view.
- Views can be dynamically added with out rebuild. 
- Each view needs to provide chart view and details view
- intial views available views will be batting average and ERA.


- Input control 
    - finish services needed
    - finish this feature to completion and move on to team standings    
    - Input control styles and layout
    - Input control do cascade at load and every change that effects cascade
    - cascade is year -> league -> division (optional by year)
    - Input control division is optional based on year, some years have no divisions
    - need to save state in app component and hook into Input Control change prop. 
    - Changes to app state will reload team standings, chart summary and details

- put this into README.md
- All services are async so when move data to database and use Node REST services. no one should be effected, except error handling
- spinner or disable all until services return
- once all data is integrated into client side app, remove data JSON files. They will be behind Node REST services and in DB eventually
- add react dev tools if needed
- add more views 
- Remove unused styles
- change favicon.ico
- Router\React router\History\back and forth
- Redux
- Node REST services
- Database
- Testing
- get away from create-react-app, do own process. Can't do node services with it, at least I couldn't configure it correctly.
- do better folder layout once get away from create-react-app
